# Homeautomation
MQTT / XBee Based Home Automation Built For Raspberry Pi

Recently there have been a lot of opensource homeautomation projects floating around but the truth is that most of them either dont work the way you want, most of them rely on a cloud platform increasing privacy risk issues & greater latency times when internet connection drops.
<br><br>
<b>List of Platform & Issues</b>
HASS - Great built over python but needs a little learning curve when it comes to automation also UI isnt customizable
Mozilla IOT - Yet in Beta stage while writing this document today tried installing twice and it fails with Wifi Issues on a Pi
Openhab - Great but yet needs a broader understanding of how it works
<br><br>
<b>Vision</b>
I believe homeautomation should work seamlessly without any latency issues and independency on cloud platforms even when your internet connection drops ensuring that data doesnt leave your premises and only stays with you.It shouldnt loose connectivity even on a powercycle and stays rock solid.It should be an enhanced version of your existing hardware without loosing it current reliability.
<br><br>
<b>Protocols</b>
MQTT - Simple, lightweight can be implemented with Wifi based projects easily<br>
Xbee - For battery operated sensors that could give us months of running time on a single/double cell.<br>
<br><br>
<b>RoadMap</b>
Create a python based platform for automation on raspberry pi3<br>
XBEE based battery operated hardware & sensors<br>
ESP8266 based wifi hardware<br>
Everything packaged in a great customizable UI<br>
Using a DDNS service to access your pi from anywhere in the world
